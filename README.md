# Kaggle-Survey-2022
This survey incluides industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning.
The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, whatâ€™s happening with machine learning in different industries
and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field. Kaggle have published all of the data rather than only the aggregated 
survey results, which makes it an unusual example of a survey dataset, as it allows analysts to investigate the data on their own.
